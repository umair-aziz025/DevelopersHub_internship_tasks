- **Week 4**: Advanced threat detection and monitoring systems
- **Week 5**: Ethical hacking and comprehensive security testing
- **Week 6**: Production-ready enterprise deployment with full security stack

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE
This project contains **MULTIPLE VERSIONS** of the same application showing security evolution:
- **Week 1**: `server.js` - Vulnerable version (educational purposes only)
- **Week 2-3**: `secure-server.js` - Basic security implementation
- **Week 4**: `enhanced-secure-server.js` - Advanced threat detection
- **Week 5**: `week5-ethical-hacking-server.js` - Ethical hacking resistant
- **Week 6**: `week6-production-server.js` - Enterprise-ready production server
- **Web Interface**: `web-interface.html` + `web-server.js` - Professional UI for testing

**⚠️ WARNING**: The vulnerable version should NEVER be deployed in production!

# Week 1: Security Assessment - Vulnerable User Management System

## 🎯 Task 1 Completed: Application Setup

### ✅ What We've Accomplished

I have successfully created a **Vulnerable User Management System** specifically designed for cybersecurity testing as per your Task 1 requirements. Here's what's been implemented:

### 🚀 Application Features
- **Frontend**: Complete HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server with SQLite database
- **Pages**: Signup, Login, and Profile management
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000 (currently running)

### 🐛 Intentional Vulnerabilities (For Week 1 Testing)

#### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
**Location**: Login, Signup, Profile endpoints
- **How to test**: Use `admin' OR '1'='1` in login fields
- **Why vulnerable**: Direct string concatenation in SQL queries
- **Impact**: Bypass authentication, data extraction

#### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Location**: Profile information display
- **How to test**: Enter `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in profile info during signup
- **Why vulnerable**: No input sanitization, using innerHTML
- **Impact**: Execute malicious scripts

#### 3. Weak Password Storage
**Location**: Database
- **Issue**: Passwords stored in plain text
- **Default admin**: username=`admin`, password=`password123`
- **Impact**: Complete account compromise if database accessed

#### 4. Information Disclosure
**Location**: API responses
- **Issue**: Passwords returned in login responses
- **How to test**: Check Network tab in browser dev tools
- **Impact**: Sensitive data exposure

#### 5. Missing Authentication
**Location**: Admin endpoints
- **Issue**: `/api/admin/users` accessible without authentication
- **How to test**: Click "View All Users" button
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to all user data

### 🔍 Week 1 Testing Instructions

#### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **SQL Injection Test**:
   ```
   Go to login page → Enter:
   Username: admin' OR '1'='1
   Password: admin' OR '1'='1
   Result: Should bypass authentication
   ```

2. **XSS Test**:
   ```
   Go to signup → Enter in profile info:
   <script>alert('XSS')</script>
   Register → View profile
   Result: Alert popup should appear
   ```

3. **Information Disclosure Test**:
   ```
   Open browser dev tools → Network tab
   Login with any credentials
   Check API response
   Result: Password visible in response
   ```

4. **Unauthorized Access Test**:
   ```
   Go to Profile tab
   Click "View All Users (Admin)"
   Result: All user data exposed without authentication
   ```

#### OWASP ZAP Testing:
1. Install OWASP ZAP
2. Configure proxy to localhost:3000
3. Run automated scan
4. Expected findings:
   - SQL Injection (High severity)
   - XSS (Medium severity)
   - Missing security headers (Low severity)
   - Information disclosure (High severity)

### 📊 Expected Week 1 Findings

| Vulnerability | Severity | Location | Test Method |
|--------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| SQL Injection | **High** | Login/Signup endpoints | Manual + ZAP |
| XSS | **Medium** | Profile display | Manual + ZAP |
| Weak Passwords | **Medium** | Database storage | Manual review |
| Info Disclosure | **High** | API responses | Network tab |
| Missing Auth | **High** | Admin endpoints | Manual |
| Missing Headers | **Low** | All responses | ZAP |

### 🎯 Week 1 Goals Achieved

✅ **Application Understanding**: Vulnerable user management system created
✅ **Vulnerability Assessment**: Multiple testable vulnerabilities implemented
✅ **Focus Areas Covered**:
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) ✅
   - Weak password storage ✅
   - Security misconfigurations ✅
   - SQL Injection ✅

### 📝 Next Steps for Documentation

Create your Week 1 assessment report documenting:

1. **Vulnerabilities Found**: List each vulnerability with severity
2. **Proof of Concept**: Screenshots of successful attacks
3. **Impact Assessment**: Potential damage from each vulnerability
4. **Areas for Improvement**: What needs to be fixed in Week 2

### 🚨 Testing Commands Quick Reference

```bash
# SQL Injection payloads
Username: admin' OR '1'='1
Username: admin' UNION SELECT * FROM users--

# XSS payloads
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
<svg onload=alert('XSS')>

# Default test account
Username: admin
Password: password123
```

### 🔧 Application Status
- ✅ Server running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Database initialized with SQLite
- ✅ All vulnerabilities active and testable
- ✅ Frontend fully functional
- ✅ Ready for OWASP ZAP scanning

## 🎉 Week 1 Task 1 Complete!

Your vulnerable application is now ready for security assessment. You can:

1. **Manual testing**: Use the browser to test SQL injection and XSS
2. **OWASP ZAP scanning**: Run automated vulnerability scans
3. **Browser dev tools**: Inspect network traffic and responses
4. **Documentation**: Create your findings report

**Next**: After completing your Week 1 assessment and documentation, we'll move to **Week 2** where we'll implement security fixes for all identified vulnerabilities.
